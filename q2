Object and its internal representation..

Object..

Meaning    :  An Object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name and a value.
A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
Object in Javascript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.

Definition : Objects in Javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or 
             reference types, in the form of "key:value" pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are
             called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

           
           Objects internal representation:
	 
	1. Generally, an object is accompanied by a class that defines an object's blueprint and consists of collection of properties, methods,etc
	2. Firstly, we create a class with a class name 
	3. Next, we create an object by writing the new keyword and assign a reference variable for it to access
	4. We initialize a javascript object by using constructor 
	5. this keyword is used inside the constructor to print the freshly created object value
	6. And, we write the values for the constructor parameter and initialize the objects field
        7. Finally, the constructor call is made and the values get printed
