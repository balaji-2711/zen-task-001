Difference between http 1.1 and http 2

HTTP 1.1
 
HTTP protocol was developed in 1989 as a common language that enables client and server machines's interaction.
Process : The client has to send a request to the server using the method(GET/POST)
Delivery modes : HTTP 1.1 sends messages as plain text.
Multiplexing : HTTP 1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
               it blocks all the other resources behind it.
Compression : HTTP 1.1 uses formats like gzip to compress the data trasferred in the messages. 
              Though the header itself is small, it gets larger due to the use of cookies or an increased
              number of request.
Advantage : Multiple domain names can use the same IP address.
            It supports Pipelining, we can send multiple outstanding requests but the responses are still serialized.

Disadvantage : Limited to processing only one request for a single TCP connection.





HTTP 2

HTTP 2 was released at Google as the significant improvement of its predecessor.
Delivery modes : HTTP 2 encodes them into binary data and arranges them carefully.
Multiplexing : HTTP 2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once 
               so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
Compression : HTTP 2 uses HPACK compression to decrease the average size of the header.
              In addition, HPACK keeps track of previously transferred header values and further compresses 
               them as per a dynamically modified index shared between client and server.
Advantage :   All the modern browsers support HTTP 2 over HTTPS with SSL certificate installation.
Disadvantage : For the client machines operating on a slow network, data packets drop bit by bit and the network 
                quality gets degraded to a single HTTP 2 connection.
